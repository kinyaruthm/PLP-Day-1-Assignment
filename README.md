# PLP-Day-1-Assignment
Introduction to Ai and Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software engineering is a field that focuses on designing, developing, testing and maintaining high quality sofware systems that meets users needs

Importance
Software engineering enables creation of softwares that improve modern life. Example the health sector and agriculture 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
Development of programming languages
Establishment of Software engineering as a principle 
Development of structured programming

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - Ths involves requirements collection from the user, analysis and planning
Design - Creation of a ptototype of the software architecture and the user interface
Implementation - This involves writing code and developing the sofware according to the design
Testing - Process of checking the system against the requirements to ensure it meets the functional requirements
Deployemnt - Process of releasing the developed software to the users
Maintenance -  A continous process of providing support to the user.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is the methodology that involves developing a complete system and deploying it to the clients. It has very minimal interactions with the user during developement phase. On the other hand, Agile methodology is a methodology where users are involved in every step of dvelopment.Agile also allows changes from the user that may be done on the software

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A sofware developer writes code to comeup with a sofware.
A quality assurance engineer performs testing during the process of development to ensure that the developed system meets the users requirements
A project manager is responsible for overseeing planning, execution and delivery of the software 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments provide platfrom for writing and testing code - example Android Studio
Version Control Systems helps keep track of changes made in a code - example Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Deadlines - Tight schedules for delivering a sofware which leads to compromised quality - Following thesofware engineering life cycle 
Changing requirements from the user which leads to consumption of more time especially for planning and developing - Cosinder agile methodology 
Lack of proper documentation - have a well done documentation before beginning to code

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - Involves testing individual modules of a system ,It helps detect ealy bugs and save on time
Integration testing - Involves testing interrelated modules of a system, ensures compatibility of the integrated modules
System Testing - Involves testing the entire system , ensures the whole system meets business goals and also the performance and quality
Acceptance testing - Involves testing the system against user requirements, ensures user requirements are met
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is a branch of engineering that involves crafting clear and precise instructions to interact with Ai.
This helps tailor responses corresponding to user requirements

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt - Discuss Chatgpt
Improved version of the prompt
Discuss the evolution of chatgpt as an example of Ai tool.

Its effeciency
Our focus is on the evolution of chatgpt
We expect a very brief response from the first Ai tool to how finally chatgp came about
